<p>Getting banned from Rocket League can feel like your boost just ran out—super frustrating, especially if you swear you played fair. This cheeky little guide will help you figure out what went wrong, what to do next, and how to politely (but firmly) get your account back in the game.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did you get banned the moment you tried a fresh account, or notice the ban follows you like a sticky boost across several accounts? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! Rocket League (or rather Psyonix/Epic) has flagged your device’s hardware, making it tough to slide back into ranked matches no matter how many alt accounts you create.</p>
